Esplora_RFID_Test
=================

A test sketch for RFID reading.
This sketch was made on/for the Arduino Esplora. It uses an RFID module (UART) from <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/125khz-rfid-module-uart-p-171.html?cPath=19_24">SeeedStudio</a>. The module is connected to the Esplora Tinkerkit Output B port (see photos).

The original purpose of this sketch was to provide access to the machine via RFID authentication. I am using at the same time the Esplora's keyboard/mouse emulation capability to output the RFID tag's key to the keyboard. Serves a dual purpose.
